The difference between a centralized repository and a distributed repository is that in the distributed each computer can be a client and also a repository.

Git init defines the stage to take shots of our project in the time it is developed, these shots are called commits.

Git add allow us to get up the file into the stage.

## UUID
UNIVELSAL UNIQUE IDENTIFIER
It has the properties for any distributed system. The distributed systems are executed in different places of software.

In a database, the tables has an ID. The ID is a key field, usually it is used as an incremental integer. It is mathematical imposible that two computers generate the same UUID. 

## SSH
SECURE SHELL
Is a protocol has many uses. In Git it generates a tunnel that comunicates the commits.
Exists two types of cryptography: symetric and asymetric.
#### Symetric
The same product produces the same value.

#### Asymetric
Any process of encryption produces diferent values.

## RSA
Rivest, Shamir & Adleman
RSA works with asymetric cryptography and it is no reversible.
The transmitter generates two keys a public and a private.
The public key is shared to the receptor and it allows them to decrypt the message sent by the transmitter.
